How spring security handles authentication ?

1. Whenever a user tries to login, then that request is intercepted by a security filter of Spring Security
called as 'UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter'.
This filter generates a token and gives it to AuthenticationManager. The Authentication manager asks
the Authentication provider to verify the Credentials.

2. Now, the token has all the credentials which is entered by the User as input.
The authentication provider calls the Custom user details service. This service has loadUserByUserName method.

3. The username which was entered by the user is passed on to the 'loaduserByUserName' and the details of the
user is fetched from the DB.

4. The credentials entered in the login form and the  data fetched from the DB is checked using the Authentication Provider.

5. If authentication succeeds then user is allowed to proceed to the endpoint which is specified at the FilterChain method. Else the
authorization attempt is denied.
